# Contribution Guidelines for Lumocs

Thank you for considering contributing to Lumocs! We value and appreciate your
help, whether it's through bug reports, feature suggestions, or pull requests.
This document outlines the standards and guidelines to follow when contributing
to Lumocs.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Before you can contribute, you need to
   [fork the Lumocs repository](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/fork).

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lumocs.git
   cd lumocs
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a branch for your feature or bugfix.
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Contribution Best Practices

1. **One Change per Pull Request**: Keep your changes focused. If you're
   submitting a bug fix, write one for that specific bug. If you're adding a new
   feature, create a separate pull request for it.

2. **Follow the Code Style**: Ensure your code adheres to the existing style of
   the project to maintain consistency.

3. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Your commit messages should explain
   the purpose of the change.

4. **Update the Documentation**: If you're adding a new feature or changing the
   functionality of existing features, please update the associated
   documentation.

5. **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting your changes, make sure all tests
   pass, and consider adding new tests for your feature or fix.

## Submitting Your Changes

1. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Submit a Pull Request**: Navigate to the Lumocs repository and click on
   "New Pull Request". Select your fork and the branch you just pushed to.

3. **Describe Your Changes**: In the pull request description, explain the
   changes you've made, any issues you're addressing, and any potential side
   effects or areas of concern.

4. **Wait for a Review**: A core contributor will review your pull request,
   provide feedback, and eventually merge it. They might ask for some changes or
   improvements.

## Feedback and Questions

For general feedback and questions, please open an issue in the Lumocs
repository. Before creating a new issue, please check if there's an existing
issue that addresses your concern.
