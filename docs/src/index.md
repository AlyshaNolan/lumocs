# Lumocs: A Documentation Theme for Lume

Welcome to Lumocs â€” an elegant and intuitive documentation theme tailored specifically for the Lume static site generator. Lumocs places your content front and center, ensuring a smooth and accessible experience for your users / readers.

## Demo Folder

For those who prefer a hands-on approach or want a quick start, check out the [`demo` folder](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo) in the Lumocs repository on GitHub. It contains a ready-made setup that showcases the capabilities of Lumocs. Simply clone and run!

## GitHub Pages Deployment

There's an example workflow included in the [`/demo/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/blob/main/demo/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) directory of the Lumocs repository. This workflow shows you how to set up GitHub Actions to handle the deployment for you.

To utilize this:

1. Copy the `deploy-pages.yml` from the [`/demo/.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo/.github/workflows) directory to your project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to `Settings`.
3. Under the `Pages` section, set the source to `GitHub Actions`.

This configuration will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to your main branch.
