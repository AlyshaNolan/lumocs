# Lumocs: A Documentation Theme for Lume

Welcome to Lumocs, a sleek stand-alone documentation theme for Lume, similar to
"just-the-docs" for Jekyll.

**Why Lumocs?**

- Design and layout **tailored for documentation**.
- Automatic light/**dark mode** by user preference.
- **No configuration** needed, **works great and looks great** out of the box.
- Generates a documentation website from **markdown**-files, using extended
  `markdown-it` syntax.
- **Easy to customize** using `_data.json` and the `_includes`-folder.
- Mobile-**responsive design**.
- Ready for deployment on **GitHub Pages**.
- **Hierarchical navigation** with up to three content levels.
- Built with **modern tools**: Deno and Lume.

Ready to get started? Check out the [Getting Started](./usage/index.md) section
for step-by-step instructions on generating your documentation site using
Lumocs.

For a hands-on experience, explore the
[demo-repository folder](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo-repository)
in the Lumocs GitHub repository. It contains a ready-made setup that
demonstrates how to integrate Lumocs into the `/docs` subfolder of an existing
project repository. Additionally, it includes an example GitHub Workflow for
automatic deployment to [GitHub Pages](./usage/deployment.md).

Whether you're documenting an open-source project, internal tools, or anything
in between, Lumocs streamlines the process, ensuring your documentation is both
informative and visually appealing.
