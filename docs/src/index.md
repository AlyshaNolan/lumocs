## Demo Folder

For those who prefer a hands-on approach or want a quick start, check out the
[`demo` folder](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo-repository) in
the Lumocs repository on GitHub. It contains a ready-made setup that showcases
how to integrate Lumocs in the `/docs` subfolder of an existing project
repository. It also contains an example GitHub Workflow for automatic deploy to
GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

There's an example workflow included in the
[`/demo/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/blob/main/demo/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
directory of the Lumocs repository. This workflow shows you how to set up GitHub
Actions to handle the deployment for you.

To utilize this:

1. Copy the `deploy-pages.yml` from the
   [`/demo/.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo/.github/workflows)
   directory to your project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to `Settings`.
3. Under the `Pages` section, set the source to `GitHub Actions`.

This configuration will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages
whenever you push to your main branch.
